# The Stream

This page is all about the stream. The stream is measured by a KAMSTRUP 162JxC smart electricity meter.
A Raspberry Pi reads the measurement data via the serialport of the meter.

Electricity production is achieved using LG NeONR LG-370Q1C-V5 (370Wp) panels with SolarEdge optimizers & SE5000 HD Wave inverter.
